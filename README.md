Schematic and PCB files: Under Development. 

Firmware: Under Development. It is possible to use firmware from similar open source designs. However, we have obtained our own USB PID through pid.codes and any ChibiCar released to the public will use this. You MUST obtain your own USB VID/PID for your projects unless you are using an ChibiCar manufactured by us. You MAY NOT release products using our USB VID/PID.

Arduino IDE Compatibility: Under Development. We are currently testing with Version 1.6.3 of the Official Arduino IDE. Installation instructions and files will be provided soon. The first releases will be "hacker friendly" but not necessarily ready for the general public.
