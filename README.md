KiCad Schematic and PCB files:  *Under Development.*

Firmware: *Under Development.*  It is possible to use firmware from similar open source designs. However, we have obtained our own USB PID through [pid.codes](http://pid.codes) and any ChibiCar released to the public will use this. **You MUST obtain your own USB VID/PID for your projects unless you are using an ChibiCar manufactured by us. You MAY NOT release products using our USB VID/PID.**

Arduino IDE Compatibility: *Under Development.*  We are currently testing with Version 1.6.3 of the [Official Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc). Installation instructions and files will be provided soon. The first releases will be "hacker friendly" but not necessarily ready for the general public.

### Attributions / Inspirations

Although the general idea for this project was conceived many years ago, its implementation was greatly assisted by the work of [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com) ([Trinket Bootloader](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Trinket-Gemma-Bootloader), [Trinket](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/introduction)), [Digispark](http://digistump.com/products/1), [MIT high-low tech](http://highlowtech.org), and all the other folks who have developed/contributed to USB implementation on the Atmel ATtiny processors.
